## Description

StoryPath is a location experience platform designed to allow users to create and explore virtual museum exhibits, location-based tours, and treasure hunts with clues. The platform features a Web app built in react that enables user to author these experiences, and a React Native Player for deploying them, making it easy to bring location-driven narratives to life.

## Advance Features

Advance Features that i chose in this project is leaflet library when user can pick a location in map and automatically transform it to Longatitude and Latitude format so user dont have to search for longatitude and latitude on the location first.
